# Jut put it out there
If you have something stored in your mind. \
Something that you think that could be put outside your mind instead. \
Like, for the the world to see. \
Just do it. Put it out there. \
There are many things one can regret about in life. \
I think one of the biggest regret is having something to show. 
But not showing it. \
That sucks. \
Just put it out there, and let the world decide.
