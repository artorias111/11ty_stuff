# Weekend podcasting plans
I've been trying to get a podcast out with a friend recently, where we talk about grad school. It's a lot of fun, and also very insightful. I feel like such conversations are very underrated, where you sit with a friend and chat about opinions/current events. I think it helps me understand how people think, and makes me want to question them. \
My friend and I decided that to start off, it's easier to talk if we're a little drunk. I guess it helps us ease to the microphone better. \
