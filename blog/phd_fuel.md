#### Breakfast
I skip breakfast. I have black coffee first thing in the morning, usually from an aeropress.

#### (Evening) Health snack(s)
It's weird to call "soup" as a snack. But it works. I like to think of it as my daily mix of veggies and nutrients. I use one of those 16 bean soup mix beans. Soak 4 servings worth of these beans (I weigh them out) in water overnight. Add the soaked and rinsed beans in a pressure cooker (I use an instant pot) with a premix chopped frozen veggies straight from the bag (obviously no soaking the veggies, that's gonna screw up your veggies). I mix 4 servings of the veggies, along with 4 cups of water. A tablespoon of salt. That's it. Pressure cook for 30 minutes. The veggies give the soup a great flavor when it's cooked for that long. You might think it goes mushy, but it does not. I avoid broccoli since they get mushy, but the rest of the vegetables work out fine. This lasts me 4 days, so I make the soup once every 4 days. I complement this with a simple egg recipe. I hate making eggs since they're so hard to clean up. But there's a nice hack I found in a Youtube short where you take an egg, add 2 teaspoons of Kewpie mayo, whisk them up and transfer to a ramekin (I mix it directly in the ramekin). I break up half a slice of American cheese into small bits, and spread it around this goop, and microwave for a minute. I get my one-egg-a-day in, and it's really tasty! The egg and the soup go really well, doesn't fill me up, and is a great evening snack.
