# My new go-to snack
I recently inherited a lot of strawberries (just one box, actually, but it felt like a lot before I found this recipe, now it's too little) from a friend. They were going to spoil soon, and were mushy, so I headed online to find a good recipe to use up my strawberries. Thanks to Fit Mitten Kitchen's [recipe](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/gluten-free-strawberry-crisp/), not only did I finish up the strawberries, I used up all my frozen berries in the Freezer too, and now I'm on my way to get more berries from the berry shop. 

Here's how I made them:

Ingredients: 
- Rolled oats
  - 1.5 cups
- Almond flour
  - 0.25 cups
- Applesauce
  - 0.25 cups
- Berries
  - 3 cups
  - Any sort, if it's strawberries I chop them into quarters. Any quantity you want, I usually use 3 cups at a time
- Maple syrup 
  - 0.25 cups
  - I use the zero sugar version from Walmart, but you can use whatever's at hand, even honey works. 
- A little bit of vanilla, and cinnamon (optional but it's great if added)



Steps: 
1. Pre-heat the oven to 350F/180C
2. Mix everything up except the berries in a bowl. 
3. Ready a baking pan, I use a cast iron pan, works great. 
4. Spread your berries on the pan. 
5. Add the mixture on top, and press it down with a spatula if needed. 
6. Bake for 50 Minutes. Check halfway to make sure nothing's going wrong or burning. 
7. Let cool for 10 mins (if you can wait 10 mins)
8. Top with zero sugar Vanilla Greek yogurt (my personal preference), or ice cream, and enjoy.
