# Double Chocolate Granola

Ingredients: 
- Rolled oats
  - 2 cups
- 
  - 0.25 cups
- Applesauce
  - 0.25 cups
- Berries
  - 3 cups
  - Any sort, if it's strawberries I chop them into quarters. Any quantity you want, I usually use 3 cups at a time
- Maple syrup 
  - 0.25 cups
  - I use the zero sugar version from Walmart, but you can use whatever's at hand, even honey works. 
- A little bit of vanilla, and cinnamon (optional but it's great if added)



Steps: 
1. Pre-heat the oven to 350F/180C
2. Mix everything up except the berries in a bowl. 
3. Ready a baking pan, I use a cast iron pan, works great. 
4. Spread your berries on the pan. 
5. Add the mixture on top, and press it down with a spatula if needed. 
6. Bake for 50 Minutes. Check halfway to make sure nothing's going wrong or burning. 
7. Let cool for 10 mins (if you can wait 10 mins)
8. Top with zero sugar Vanilla Greek yogurt (my personal preference), or ice cream, and enjoy.
