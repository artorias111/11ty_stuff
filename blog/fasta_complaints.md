# naive Fasta complaints
We have a lot of biological sequences floating around. We also have a lot of storage space, just look at all the datacenters around the world. If this was true, that'd be the end of the story. The problem is, we're creating a lot more biological data than what we're capable of handling. In my experience, with not enough money for storage space, I'm expected to clean up after myself, or "delete" some of my data, especially raw sequencing readsforever. That sucks. I wish there was a better solution to this. \
I can think of a few solutions off the top of my head, but they all sound ambitious. But something that irks me every day, every single day, is the use of fasta files to store dna data. Why? Who decided that's a good idea?
