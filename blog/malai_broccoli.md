# Another go-to snack
I purchased a big bag of broccoli, and then I didn't know what to do with it. So here's a marinated Indian style broccoli recipe inspired by [Shweta](https://www.youtube.com/@shwetasgenielife/) (I couldn't find a website so I added her Youtube channel). The prep time is almost instantaneous, and it's super tasty. And the best part, you get quite a bit of broccoli into your system. 

Here's how I made them:

Ingredients: 
- Chopped broccoli
  - About 120g. 
- Chickpea flour (Besan)
  - About 10g. 
  - Adds a little bit of crunch, and some marginal increase in protein content, so win-win
- Ginger garlic paste
  - About 15g
- Spice mix
  - Any indian spices work I eyeball them. I used Red Chilli powder, Turmeric, and Garam masala for this. But feel free to explore. 
- Greek yogurt
  - Around 100g. 
  - I love Fage 2%. You can use whatever's available. 
- Salt


Steps: 
1. Mix everything except the broccoli in a bowl. You should get a thick paste-like consistency. 
2. Slowly add in the broccoli and 'marinate' them with the mixture. 
3. Add them to the lined air fryer basket. Line it if you don't want to make a mess in your air fryer. 
4. Air fry for 15 minutes, shaking/flipping halfway. 
5. Enjoy with your favorite hot sauce/dipping sauce. I top it with spicy chili crisp and it's great.
